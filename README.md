## Grape Leaf Disease Identifier
This project involves a Flask-based web application to diagnose diseases in grape leaves using two trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. One model detects if an uploaded image is a grape leaf, while the other identifies specific diseases affecting the leaf. The app provides disease-specific information, care suggestions, and fertilizer recommendations.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): This is implemented using TensorFlowâ€™s Keras API to classify diseases in grape leaves based on image data.

2. Binary Classification (Sigmoid Output Layer): This is used in the grape leaf classifier model to determine if an image is of a grape leaf or not.

## Python Libraries
1. Flask
2. TensorFlow/Keras
3. NumPy
4. OpenCV
5. sklearn

## How to Run the Project
Step 1: Download the project files in a zip format. <br>
Step 2: Extract the code using your preferred application, such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode). <br>
Step 3: Install all required Python libraries using the commands ? <br>
Step 4: Download the dataset from the Kaggle website and place it in the appropriate folder as specified in the code.<br>
Step 5: Run the model.py script (use the command python model.py). This will automatically download all necessary data and prepare the models for training.<br>
Step 6: Finally, run the app.py script (use the command python app.py). Your project will now be up and running.<br>

## Instructions to Run the Project
Unfortunately, due to file upload restrictions, I am unable to upload the dataset or the requirements file (such as .h5 model files). However, you can easily download the dataset directly from Kaggle and run the project on your local machine
